## Project Planning and Development Tips

### Before Starting Any Project

#### Planning Phase
1. **Sketch your idea**: Draw what the project should look like
2. **List required features**: What should the project do?
3. **Break into small steps**: Don't try to build everything at once
4. **Choose appropriate sprites**: Find or create characters and objects
5. **Plan the user experience**: How will people interact with your project?

#### Development Best Practices
- **Start simple**: Build basic functionality first
- **Test frequently**: Run your project often to catch problems early
- **Save regularly**: Use meaningful project names and save versions
- **Comment your code**: Use labels to remember what blocks do
- **Get feedback**: Show your work to friends and family for suggestions

### Debugging Common Problems

#### Sprites Not Moving Correctly
- Check that motion blocks are inside event blocks
- Verify that sprites aren't touching edges or other objects
- Ensure coordinate values are reasonable (not too large/small)

#### Sounds Not Playing
- Confirm sound files are properly imported
- Check volume levels in both Scratch and computer settings
- Verify that sound blocks are triggered by events

#### Interactions Not Working
- Double-check event blocks (when clicked, when key pressed)
- Ensure sprites are visible and not hidden behind others
- Verify that sensing blocks are detecting the right objects

### Showcasing and Sharing Projects

#### Preparing for Presentation
1. **Create clear instructions**: How do others use your project?
2. **Add title screens**: Professional-looking introduction
3. **Include credits**: Acknowledge helpers and resources used
4. **Test with others**: Make sure instructions are clear
5. **Practice explaining**: Be ready to describe how you built it

#### Sharing Safely Online
- **Use Scratch community guidelines**: Follow platform rules
- **Don't share personal information**: Keep identity private
- **Be respectful in comments**: Give constructive feedback
- **Report inappropriate content**: Help keep the community safe
