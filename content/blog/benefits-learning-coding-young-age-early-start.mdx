In our increasingly digital world, coding literacy is becoming as fundamental as reading and writing. By introducing programming early, we give children the tools to be creators rather than just consumers of technology, problem-solvers rather than passive recipients of solutions.

The question isn't whether to introduce coding to young childrenâ€”it's how to do it in ways that maximize the cognitive, academic, and social benefits while keeping learning fun and engaging.

Start early, start simple, and watch as your child develops skills that will serve them for a lifetime.
