#### **Middle School (Grades 6-8)**
- **MATHCOUNTS**: Premier middle school competition in the US
- **AMC 8**: American Mathematics Competition for grade 8 and below
- **Purple Comet**: International online team competition

#### **High School (Grades 9-12)**
- **AMC 10/12**: Gateway to higher-level competitions
- **AIME**: American Invitational Mathematics Examination
- **USAMO/USAJMO**: United States Mathematical Olympiad

## üßÆ Essential Math Topics by Level

### **Foundation Topics (All Levels)**
- **Number Theory**: Divisibility, prime numbers, modular arithmetic
- **Algebra**: Equations, inequalities, polynomials
- **Geometry**: Basic theorems, coordinate geometry, area/volume
- **Combinatorics**: Counting principles, permutations, combinations

### **Advanced Topics (High School)**
- **Complex Numbers**: Operations and geometric interpretations
- **Advanced Geometry**: Trigonometry, circles, transformations
- **Graph Theory**: Networks, paths, optimization
- **Calculus Concepts**: Limits, derivatives (for some competitions)

## üìö Step-by-Step Preparation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation Building (3-4 months)**

#### Week 1-4: Core Concepts
- **Number Theory fundamentals**
  - Divisibility rules and GCD/LCM
  - Prime factorization and Sieve of Eratosthenes
  - Modular arithmetic basics

**Practice Problem:**
*Find the last two digits of 3^100.*

#### Week 5-8: Algebraic Thinking
- **Equation solving techniques**
- **Inequality manipulation**
- **Polynomial basics and factoring**

#### Week 9-12: Geometric Intuition
- **Triangle properties and theorems**
- **Circle geometry**
- **Coordinate geometry applications**

#### Week 13-16: Counting Principles
- **Basic combinatorics**
- **Pigeonhole principle**
- **Inclusion-exclusion principle**

### **Phase 2: Skill Development (4-5 months)**

#### Advanced Problem-Solving Techniques

**1. Working Backwards**
- Start from the desired conclusion
- Trace logical steps in reverse
- Particularly useful for construction problems

**2. Proof by Contradiction**
- Assume the opposite of what you want to prove
- Show this leads to an impossibility
- Essential for many olympiad problems

**3. Invariants and Monovariants**
- Find quantities that remain constant
- Or quantities that always increase/decrease
- Powerful for game theory and sequence problems

**4. Extremal Principle**
- Consider the largest, smallest, or extreme cases
- Often leads to clean solutions
- Common in geometry and optimization

### **Phase 3: Competition Practice (2-3 months)**

#### Mock Competition Schedule
- **Weekly timed tests**: Simulate real competition conditions
- **Problem analysis**: Understand solution approaches
- **Speed building**: Increase accuracy under time pressure
- **Mental math drills**: Quick calculation techniques

## üèÜ Proven Study Methods

### **Daily Practice Routine**

#### **Weekdays (1.5-2 hours)**
- **30 minutes**: Review previous day's problems
- **45 minutes**: New problem practice (3-4 problems)
- **30 minutes**: Theory study or technique learning
- **15 minutes**: Mental math drills

#### **Weekends (3-4 hours)**
- **1 hour**: Mock competition (timed)
- **1 hour**: Problem analysis and alternative solutions
- **1 hour**: Topic-focused deep dive
- **1 hour**: Fun problems and exploration

### **The RICE Method for Problem Solving**

**R - Read** the problem multiple times
- Understand what's being asked
- Identify given information
- Note any special conditions

**I - Identify** relevant concepts and techniques
- What mathematical areas are involved?
- Have you seen similar problems?
- What theorems might apply?

**C - Create** a solution strategy
- Break down complex problems
- Consider multiple approaches
- Start with simpler cases

**E - Execute** and verify
- Implement your solution carefully
- Check your work for errors
- Verify the answer makes sense
